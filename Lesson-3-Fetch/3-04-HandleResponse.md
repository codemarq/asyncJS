# Handle The Response

Ok, you've learned about making a Fetch request, and you've sent a few of them off...but nothing happened because we didn't tell our code to handle the response. Let's get our code ready to handle the response.

Remember that Fetch is Promise-based. This means that when we fire of the Fetch request, it will automatically return a promise that we can use to listen for the response.

>## ðŸ’¡ Javascript Promises Reminder ðŸ’¡
>Dealing with the returned data from a Fetch request is all done with Promises, so if any of this looks confusing or you don't know how `.then()` works or why it's needed, check out our [course on JavaScript Promises](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898).

Since a Fetch request returns a Promise, then all you have to do is call `.then()` on that Promise.

```js
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`, {
    headers: {
        Authorization: 'Client-ID abc123'
    }
}).then(function(response) {
    debugger; // work with the returned response
});
```

If you haven't already, put the code above in our JavaScript file and search for something. Because we added a debugger line inside the `.then()` function, the code will pause on the debugger line when the response is finally returned.

### QUIZ QUESTION

We've successfully made the request, and you should be able to see the response in your console. Which property has the actual JSON data of the images?

- [ ] `.data`
- [ ] `.images`
- [ ] `.response`
- [ ] both `.images` and `.data`
- [X] none of the above
