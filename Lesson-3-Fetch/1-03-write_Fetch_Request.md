# Write The Fetch Request

Ok, let's look at a sample fetch request, and then we'll make a fetch request for an image from Unsplash.

```js
fetch('<URL-to-the-resource-that-is-being-requested>');
```

So yeah...that's it. In it's smallest form, a Fetch request is just the `fetch()` function and a string to the resource that's being requested. It's just so short and easy to read (sigh I think I'm in love!). Let's take a peek at what a real request looks like:

```js
fetch('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=flowers');
```

If you try running this Fetch request on the console, then you should get a Promise returned to you.

>Did you just try running the Fetch request and it didn't work? Were you running it on Unsplash's website? If not, make sure you go to [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/), open the console, and try running it from there.

>Just because Fetch is new and awesome and is replacing the XHR object for making asynchronous network requests *doesn't* mean it can bypass the rules for making those network requests. **Fetch requests still need to obey the cross-origin protocol** of how resources are shared. This means that, by default, you can only make requests for assets and data on the same domain as the site that will end up loading the data.

Remember that Unsplash requires an Authorization header to make a request through its API. Check out these links on Fetch's documentation to see how to add an `Authorization` header to the Fetch request.

### QUESTION 1 OF 2

Docs are a dev's best friend! Take a quick look through them and pick the correct way(s) to add a header to a Fetch request from the options below. Also, instead of cheating and guessing, try testing out the code you think is correct in your app or on the console to see how it runs!

- [ ]

```js
fetch.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Client-ID abc123');
fetch(https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText});
```

- [ ]

```js
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`, {
     headers: { 
         Authorization: 'Client-ID abc123'
    }
});
```

- [ ]

```js
const requestHeaders = new Headers();
requestHeaders.append('Authorization', 'Client-ID abc123');
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`, {
     headers: requestHeaders
});
```

- [ ]

```js
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`).then(function(request){
     request.addHeader('Authorization', 'Client-ID abc123');
});
```

### QUESTION 2 OF 2

What do you think the default HTTP method is for a Fetch request? Why don't you try running a Fetch request and look in the DevTools to see the HTTP method that is used.

Check out these links from the specification to find out more:

- [https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#methods](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#methods)
- [https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requests)

- [ ] FETCH
- [ ] fetch
- [ ] POST
- [ ] post
- [X] GET
- [ ] get
- [ ] REQUEST
- [ ] request

## Changing The HTTP Method

So the default HTTP method for a Fetch request is the `GET` method. We can choose a different HTTP method by passing a `method` property in the configuration object:

```js
fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`, {
    method: 'POST'
});
```

This will send the request with the `POST` HTTP header.

Fetch's specification does not limit what HTTP methods can be used, although it does recommend that all methods are written in uppercase for consistency with the HTTP Verbs specification.
