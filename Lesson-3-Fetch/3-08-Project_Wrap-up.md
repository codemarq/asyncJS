# Project Wrap-up

## Add NY Times Code

The app is now able to handle searching for images and displaying images! Woohoo! Now see if you can follow these same steps to get the New York Times articles to display. When you can perform a search in your app and have both an image and some New York Times articles display, check the checkbox below. This might seem like a lot, but we looked in detail at how to make a Fetch request and how to handle the response. You're basically going to follow the exact same steps for this request. You'll need to: make the request to the NYTimes API convert the response to JSON loop through the JSON data and add the articles to the page Bonus points if you use `.catch()` to handle any network errors!

> - [X] I've added the NYTimes code, and articles are being added to the page!
